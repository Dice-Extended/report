## Overview

[Mothilal et al. (2020)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3351095.3372850) introduce their method of generating counterfactual explanations considering _feasibility_, and _diversity_. [Guidotti and Ruggieri (2021)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88942-5_28), claim counterfactual explanations to be robust they should be similar for similar instances when they explain. In this study, in a search to improve the quality and reliability of the counterfactual explanations _robustness_ is found to be helpful and it also introduced in the optimization function.

DiCE-Extended is built upon the [DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations)](https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE) [(Mothilal et al. 2020)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3351095.3372850) framework by introducing a robustness term in the optimization function.

## Installation

DiCE-Extended requires Python 3.6 or higher. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install dice-extended
```

Alternatively, install via conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge dice-extended
```

## Getting Started

The following code piece provides an idea on how to generate counterfactual explanations with dice-extended (The code will be updated):

```python
import dice_ml_x
from dice_ml_x.utils import helpers
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
dataset = helpers.load_adult_income_dataset()
target = dataset["income"]
train_dataset, test_dataset, _, _ = train_test_split(
    dataset, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=0, stratify=target
)

# Initialize Data and Model
d = dice_ml_x.Data(
    dataframe=train_dataset,
    continuous_features=['age', 'hours_per_week'],
    outcome_name='income'
)
m = dice_ml_x.Model(
    model_path=dice_ml.utils.helpers.get_adult_income_modelpath(),
    backend='TF2',
    func="ohe-min-max"
)

# Generate Counterfactual Explanations
exp = dice_ml_x.DiceX(d, m)
query_instance = test_dataset.drop(columns="income")[0:1]
dice_exp = exp.generate_counterfactuals(
    query_instance, total_CFs=4, desired_class="opposite"
)
dice_exp.visualize_as_dataframe()
```

## Manipulated Optimization Function

The core enhancement in DiCE-Extended is the manipulated optimization function, designed to balance proximity, diversity, and feasibility of counterfactuals. The function is formulated as:

<!-- 
$$ C(x) = \operatorname*{arg\,min}_{c_1, ... , c_k} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i}^{k}yloss(f (c_i ), y) + \frac{\lambda_1}{k}\sum_{i}^{k}dist(c_i , x) - \lambda_2*dpp\_diversity(c_1, ... ,c_k) - \frac{\lambda_3}{k}\sum_{i}^{k}robustness(c_i, c_i') $$
-->

$$
C(x) = \underset{c_1, ..., c_k}{\text{arg min}}
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{k} yloss(f(c_i), y) +
\frac{\lambda_1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} dist(c_i, x) -
\lambda_2 \cdot dpp\_diversity(c_1, ..., c_k) -
\frac{\lambda_3}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} robustness(c_i, c_i')
$$

- **Proximity Loss**: The first term that averages the distance between generated counterfactuals and the original input ensure the counterfactuals to be as close as possible to the original input.
- **Diversity Loss**: Diversity of the counterfactual explanations is aquired by determinental point process of which loss is represented by the second term and it ensures that _k_ number of counterfactual explanations are generated.
- **Robustness Loss**: [Guidotti (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-022-00831-6) defines robustness as necessity of similar instances being explained by similar counterfactual explanations such that if $b(x_1)=b(x_2)=y$ then an explainer $f$ should generate counterfactuals $c_1$ and $c_2$ that are similar and can explain $x_1$ and $x_2$. The robustness term that is based on [Dice-Sørensen Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice-S%C3%B8rensen_coefficient), is adopted from [Bonasera and Carrizosa (2024)](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.00843).

$$Robustness(c_i, c_i') = \frac{2 * \lvert c_i \cap c_i' \rvert}{\lvert c_i \rvert + \lvert c_i' \rvert} $$

By adjusting the weights $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, $\lambda_3$ counterfactual explanations can be customised by specific needs.

## Evaluation

For experimental purposes, $\lambda_3$, the coefficient of the robustness loss, is set to `0.2`. For counterfactual generation by considering the robustness **genetic algorithm** is adapted to the modified loss function given above.

### Preliminary Evaluation

Since computing robustness loss requires generating perturbed version of the counterfactual instance generated for a given original instance, a perturbation module is integrated to the project. In the module, `gaussian`, `spherical`, and `random` perturbation strategies are introduced. The Gaussian perturbation generation strategy generates perturbed counterfactual instances by uniformly perturbing the continuous features and randomly perturbing the categorical features. To guarantee the convergence `L-BFGS-B`*(Limited Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno Bounded)* optimization algorithm and brute-force method are combined. For the remaining strategies brute-force approach is adopted. The outputs and the time required for generation of each strategies are given below.
